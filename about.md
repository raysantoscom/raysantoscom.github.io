When I was in the 5th grade the answers I calculated for math division problems were consistently wrong because I hadn't yet understood how to correctly multiply numbers. My teacher (Mr. Tedesco, who would sometimes play his saxaphone at school) lost patience teaching me division and multiplication, so for one week he sent me to a classroom of 3rd graders to learn how to add and to subtract numbers using colored beads. 

I remember feeling humiliated. I dreaded going to school after that experience.

During my junior-high school years (7th to 9th grade) I did the minimum amount of work needed to earn the passing grade of C for all of my classes. During my high school years (10th to 12th grade) I had a dismal grade point average. I failed a required U.S. Government course during the last semester of my senior year, which resulted in my not qualifying to participate in my high school graduation ceremony. I had to take, and pass with grade C or better, a civics course that summer to satisfy the failed requirement. 

I passed the civics course with grade A, after which I received my high school diploma through the mail.

After high school I attended a local community college as a declared Philosophy major. Because of my low college placement test scores I had to enroll in remedial math and english courses. Having never developed a study-skills foundation and having a poorly developed high school level education, I dropped out of community college halfway into the semester and I enlisted in the U.S. Army to be an airborne infantryman.

The discipline I learned and developed during my military years gave me an appreciation for formal education and the desire to give college a second attempt. After my enlistment ended I returned to the community college that I had dropped-out from five years earlier and I earned an associates degree in Information Systems. While working full-time in the tech industry I completed two years of night and weekend university courses to earn a bachelors degree in Information System. Ten years later I again put myself through two years of night and weekend university courses to earn a masters degree in Software Engineering.

After earning the masters degree in 2006 I completed additional formal college-level courses on acting, Japanese language, music, programming languages, project management, and Spanish language, to name a few. All for the fun of learning. I also completed nearly a dozen online courses combined from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), [edX](https://www.edx.org), and [MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm). Again, all for the fun of learning.

In September 2013 I borrowed from my local library a book titled "Climbing Parnassus - A New Apologia for Greek and Latin" by Tracy Lee Simmons, which got me interested in the Classical Education movement. Up to that point the majority of my post high school academic work focused on learning the theory and skills I needed to build a career in the software industry. 

I now wanted to get the classical education I never had. 

Since September 2013 I've done random casual reading about Classical Education topics and I've skimmed through several introductory Latin language books. I've also researched colleges and universities that offer Classical Education Studies degree programs online. 

In the end, I decided to give myself a classical education through self-directed study.

I created this blog site to record my plans, thoughts, works, and discoveries made during my self-directed classical education journey. I expect this to be a lifetime pursuit of classical education learning.

If you're interested in giving yourself the classical education that you never got or if you're interested in self-directed learning, then this blog is for you.
