Today's post is about *Chapter 3, Keeping the Journal: A Written Record of New Ideas*, from [The Well-Educated Mind](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393050947/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393050947&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=DLLLQ6NYPWZMLZ7A) by Susan Wise Bauer.

###Summary

The first step of classical self-education is the mastery of facts. In order to master facts you must be able to capture, analyze, understand, and develop your own conclusions about the ideas derived from those facts.

The most reliable and time-proven way to master the content that you read is summarizing in your own words what the author wrote, and then writing down your reactions, thoughts, and feelings about the summary.

####Reading and Journaling Guidelines

1. Write the chapter's title at the top of the journal's page.

2. Read the chapter once from start to finish without stopping. Write down notes only for sentences, quotes, thoughts, or ideas that catch your attention during your reading.

3. After the chapter reading is completed, identify the chapter's major sections and read the chapter again. After reading each section, write in your own words a summary of the section. Ask yourself the following questions while writing the summary:
  - What is the author's most important point?
  - What one thing about the section stands out to me?
  - What else important is the author writing about in this section? 

4. After all chapter summaries are written, go back and read each summary. For each summary, write down your reactions to the content that you wrote.

###Reactions to Summary

Doing **serious** reading requires a lot of effort. It also increases the time commitment by double, or more, over casual reading.

After reading each chapter twice, then writing **in my own words** a summary of each section, *and then* writing down my reactions to each of the summaries, there's no doubt in my mind about mastering each chapter's content.
