The ideas that I found most interesting from Chapter 2, *Wrestling with Books: The Act of Reading*, of [The Well-Educated Mind](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393050947/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393050947&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=DLLLQ6NYPWZMLZ7A) are:

* The goal of (general) reading is to gather data and to collect facts in order to be an informed person and nothing more. The goal of **serious** reading is, in addition to gathering data and collecting facts, to use that information to understand ideas and to develop wisdom. 

* "To be informed is to know simply that something is the case. To be enlightened is to know, in addition, what it is about." -- Mortimer Adler, *How to Read a Book*

* "The serious reader is not attempting to assimilate a huge quantity of information as quickly as possible, but to **understand a few many-sided and elusive ideas**." -- Susan Wise Bauer, page 27.

* Serious reading is a life-long process. There's no need to speed-read. 

Three practices from Chapter 2 that I'll do while reading are: 

1. Serious reading is not a race. Read slowly and deliberately, but not so slow and with a lack of concentration that you're constantly re-reading sentences that you already understand.

2. When a difficult passage is encountered, do a preview scan of the passage to get a general sense of its main idea, then read the passage from beginning to end with full concentration.

3. For the reading of books related to this self-learning classical education project, read with the goals of gaining wisdom and becoming enlightened. 

After I finish reading the first four chapters of *The Well-Educated Mind*, I'll start reading Mortimer Adler's [How to Read a Book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671212095/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0671212095&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=6TEXUQW7S7TOC7KV).
