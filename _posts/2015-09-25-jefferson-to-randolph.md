Today's post is about Thomas Jefferson's [August 27, 1786 letter](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Letter_to_Thomas_Mann_Randolph,_Jr._-_August_27,_1786) to Thomas Mann Randolph, Jr. 

I first learned about Jefferson's letter from a footnote on page 14, Chapter 1, of [The Well-Educated Mind](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393050947/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393050947&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=DLLLQ6NYPWZMLZ7A) by Susan Wise Bauer.

###Background

Thomas Jefferson wrote [this letter](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Letter_to_Thomas_Mann_Randolph,_Jr._-_August_27,_1786) to the then 18 year-old Thomas Mann Randolph, Jr., who was Jefferson's [second cousin once removed](http://lifehacker.com/second-cousins-once-removed-and-more-explained-in-1661572056), and who was also Jefferson's future son-in-law.

Randolph, Jr. was living in Paris at the time and he planned to move back to the United States. In the letter, Jefferson offers advice to Randolph, Jr. about the pursuit of higher education and the importance of a healthy body.

###Summary

Thomas Mann Randolph, Jr., you have the foundation of language and mathematics upon which to further build your knowledge. Language strengthens the mind and memory. Mathematics strengthens our reasoning skills. An extra benefit of mathematics is that it is applicable to many other branches of study, especially in the sciences.

Build on top of this foundation an extensive knowledge of Astronomy, Natural Philosophy, Natural History, Anatomy, Botony, and Chemistry. Don't attempt to master all of these subjects because the human lifespan isn't long enough to allow for it. Instead, find one subject area that interests you the most and master it, while still maintaining your general knowledge of the other subject areas.

Take full advantage of your opportunity to attend university. You will regret it if you don't. Supplement your formal classroom education by self-educating yourself outside of the classroom. Choose the best books that will help you to close any knowledge gaps. Read whenever you can.

Slow down the intensity of your studying during evening hours. Studying history is best during the evening because it exercises your memory. Read the books in each area of study in the chronological order in which they were written.

Reading Greek and Roman histories in their original languages of Greek and Latin, respectively, is recommended over reading compiled derivatives of the original source material. After you finish your formal studies of the previously mentioned subjects, study law next.

When the opportunity presents itself, experience living in other cultures and learn how to speak another language.

Maintaining a healthy body is just as important, or more, as building your mind. Walking is the best exercise. Start walking short distances if you're not used to exercising and slowly increase the numbers of miles that you walk daily. Devote as least two hours each day to exercise, rain or shine.

Build and maintain your resistance to sickness by taking cold showers, eating a simple diet, and getting lots of sun and fresh air daily.

###Reactions to Summary
Thomas Mann Randolph, Jr. was fortunate to have Thomas Jefferson give him solid advice on how to pursue higher-level academics and on how to maintain a healthy body.

I like that over 200 years ago Jefferson promoted the importance of pursuing self-education by reading books outside of formal classroom lectures in order to close knowledge gaps and to gain additional knowledge not covered in university.

Jefferson's recommendation of studying with less intensity during the evening hours is what I need to work on. I do all of my studying during evening hours because I work full-time during the day. On those evenings when my studying effort is extra focused, I have a hard time falling asleep because my mind is racing with a multitude of thoughts and ideas.

I agree with Jefferson that exercising the body is just as important, if not more so, as exercising the mind. In addition to being a self-directed learner for years, I've always stayed physically active. I wish that ice cold water came out of my shower head at home when the shower is set only to cold. The coldest water I get is lukewarm.

One of my life's goals is to live outside of the United States for at least two full years and immerse myself in the destination country's culture and language. As of this writing my top two countries are [Chiang Mai, Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Mai) and [Merida, Yucatan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9rida,_Yucat%C3%A1n).
