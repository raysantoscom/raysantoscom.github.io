Today's post is about *Chapter 4, Starting to Read: Final Preparations*, from [The Well-Educated Mind](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393050947/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393050947&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=DLLLQ6NYPWZMLZ7A) by Susan Wise Bauer.

###Section 1 Summary
Serious reading is hard work, not necessarily because the activity requires a high-level of intelligence, but because serious reading is a difficult task to do.

Difficult tasks are easy to manage and to complete when it's divided into sub-tasks. The sub-tasks of serious reading are:

  1. Understand the book's structure and what the author is saying.
  2. Analyze each of the author's arguments.
  3. Explain why you agree or disagree with what the author wrote.

Plan to read the book (or selected material) at least three times. The first reading is done from beginning to end to get a high-level understanding of the book's content and the author's overall message. The second reading is used to evaluate the truthfulness and accuracy of the ideas that support the author's message. Finally, the third reading (while referencing your notes from the second reading) is used to develop your reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with the author.

####Reactions to Summary
Be prepared to invest the time needed to gain a mastery understanding of a book's content. It won't be easy, but it's achievable.

###Section 2 Summary of *A Note on Evaluation*
The goal of understanding and evaluating a book is to form your own opinions about the book's written content.

Only **after** you have established your own firm opinions about the book should you seek out other people's opinions about the book, whether through in-person conversations or from reading the opinions of others.

Comparing and contrasting your opinions of a book with the opinions of others will help you gauge your understanding of the book's message.

####Reactions to Summary 
Don't let the opinions of others influence the development of my initial opinions of a book. Seek out and welcome the opinions of others about the book only after I have developed my own fully supported opinions.

###Section 3 Summary of *A Note on the Lists that Follow*
Read the books of a subject area in the chronological order in which they were written. Doing so will take you through the evolution of the subject area and you will see how the ideas presented in earlier books are expanded upon or challenged by books that follow.

Don't feel obligated to apply the understand/evaluate/opinionate process to every book that you read.

All reading lists are subjective. Modify the subject area's reading list for you.

####Reactions to Summary
Find several classical education reading lists and use them to create my own reading list by subject areas. For best results, it's important that I read the books in each subject area in the chronological order in which they were written.

####Postscript
This ends my planned reading of *The Well-Educated Mind* for now.

Part 2 of the book provides five chapters of reading lists, with each chapter focused on one of five different types of literature (fiction, autobiography, history and politics, drama, poetry). 

A synopsis is provided for each recommended book; however, I recommend **not** reading the synopses for the books in the fiction, drama, and poetry lists. They are spoilers.

Each of the five reading list chapters gives you a high-level historical overview of the literature type. You're given reading guidelines that are specific for the literature type and you're given suggested questions to ask yourself during your reading sessions.

Finally, author Susan Wise Bauer gives you her recommended "Best Edition" of each book to read, which I appreciate. 

I borrowed my copy (from 2003) of *The Well-Educated Mind* from my local library. An ["Updated and Expanded" edition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/039308096X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=039308096X&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=WTLJQLZKT642CJWI) of the book is scheduled for release on November 16, 2015.

It's on my [amazon.com wishlist](https://amzn.com/w/2WWAOPVELP2BO), in case you're feeling extra generous today.
