*Part I (Beginning: Preparing for Classical Education)* of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393050947/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393050947&linkCode=as2&tag=6767151-20&linkId=QYRGM4QQNJPX3X7U">The Well-Educated Mind</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=6767151-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0393050947" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by Susan Wise Bauer, is the book that I'm using as my guide to lay the foundation from which to build my self-directed classical education.

The book's sub-title is *A Guide to the Classical Education You Never Had*.

Ideas from Chapter 1 that stood out to me are:

* Sustained serious reading is at the center of the self-education project.
* Study one subject at a time.
* Read books in the order in which they were written.
* Reserve time during the day for self-education.
* Don't schedule yourself for study time every day of the week.
* Guard your reading time.

The second and third bullet items stood out the most for me because Wise Bauer recommends the opposite of how I study subjects and read books.

During my weekly visits to the local library I like borrowing at one time multiple books that cover multiple subject areas. The order in which I read the books is based on which book is within arm's reach.

As recommended by Wise Bauer, studying one subject at a time and reading books within that subject in the order in which they were written does make sense. Ideas from a subject's foundational works might be referenced, further developed, or opposed by books in the same subject area that follow it.

Footnotes in Chapter 1 of "The Well-Educated Mind" referenced one letter and one speech that I think are worth reading. Both are online.

* [Education of a Future Son-in-Law](http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/presidents/thomas-jefferson/letters-of-thomas-jefferson/jefl48.php). A letter from Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Mann Randolph, Jr., dated August 27, 1786.
* [The Lost Tools of Learning](http://www.gbt.org/text/sayers.html). A speech given by Dorothy L. Sayers at Oxford University in 1947.

After I read the letter and the speech and give my brain some time to think about them, I'll share my thoughts about each of them here in separate blog posts.
